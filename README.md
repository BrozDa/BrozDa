## Network Engineer | Aspiring Software Developer | C# & .NET Enthusiast

Originally, I started learning coding to enhance my networking skills. However, I quickly became hooked about software development and am now actively working toward transitioning into a software development role.

## Tech Stack & Skills
* Algorithms and Data Structures
* C#, .NET, ASP .NET Core, EF Core
* Visual Studio, Swagger, Postman, Papercut
* Git & GitHub

## Currently learning
After establishing (by my opinion) a solid base I started focusing on system design and design patterns to help me while designing future projects.

## Featured Projects:
### [Taskify](https://github.com/BrozDa/Taskify)

A full-stack task management application built with ASP.NET Core Web API and React. The app includes JWT-based authentication, allowing users to securely create, edit, complete, and delete tasks with priorities, due dates, and custom tags. Data persistence is handled through EF Core with relational modeling. The UI is styled with Tailwind and tested for responsiveness across devices. 

### [Inventory-Order-Tracking-API](https://github.com/BrozDa/Inventory-Order-Tracking-API)
An ASP.NET Core Web API simulating an order management system. The API manages JWT based authentication with refresh keys, products, orders, and audit logs with role based access, user email verification and stock validation. Data persistence is handled through EF Core with relational modeling. The API was tested using unit tests, mocks, and manual checks with Postman.

## Other smaller projects:
### [ShoppingList](https://github.com/BrozDa/CodeReviews.React.ShoppingList)
A lightweight full-stack application allowing to track a shopping list - adding, removing, marking items. Build with ASP .NET Core Backend and React + Tailwind responsive front end.

### [ExcelReader](https://github.com/BrozDa/CodeReviews.Console.ExcelReader)
A console app allowing  reading data from an .xlsx or .csv file, storing the content in a database, and exporting the data back to an .xlsx or .csv file.

### [SportsResults](https://github.com/BrozDa/CodeReviews.Console.SportsResults)
